* Compare logistic regression, KNN and decision trees classifiers
* Use a voting classifier
* Tune the hyperparameters of the decision tree classifer and use the ROC AUC score as a metric
* Train an AdaBoost ensemble to perform the classification task and use the ROC AUC score as a metric instead of accuracy
* Use bagging
